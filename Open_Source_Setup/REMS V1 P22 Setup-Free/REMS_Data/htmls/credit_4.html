                         <strong>4.1.1 <u>CREDIT PACKAGES</u></strong><br />
                         Following are the basic components of a CA Package:<br />
                         1. CA Face and facility listing<br />
                         2. CA Remarks and financial analysis<br />
                         3. Basic Information Report<br />
                         4. Spreads<br />
                         5. Marketing Plan and Budget Form<br />
                         6. Checklists: RAACs, Documentation, Credit Administration<br />
                         7. Trade/Bank and Registrar Checking.<br />
                         Of these, only items 1 through 4 are required by ETI's CPC in Lome if the credit needs to be submitted to them for approval. ' Where there is a term loan, the following additional items are required:<br />
                         1. term Loan Agreement<br />
                         2. Term Loan Summary<br />
                         3. Term Loan Checklist.<br />
                         The length of a CA package is dependent upon the complexity of the credit and whether it is an initial, interim or annual CA.<br />
                         1. An initial CA secured by cash collateral, Third Party Collaterals or Standby Letters of Credit does not require an in-depth financial analysis. However, it will need to have a comprehensive background section. Therefore, although not complex from a risk point of view, the initial CA could still be a lengthy document.<br />
                         2. Similarly, a CA for products like guarantees and bonds to the Immigration, Customs, etc., secured by 100% cash collateral primarily requested by some key liability (depository) customers, will not require an in-depth financial analysis. The CA components will tee: a CA face, CA Remarks, a BIR, Checkings from one Bank and One Trade source, and the related credit documentation.<br />
                         While there is no rigid rule as to how long a CA package should tee, all packages should be as concise as possible with the minimum of duplication.<br />
                         Wherever possible and with appropriate approval, certain parts of the credit package such as BIRs, Spread Sheets, should be automated via available micro-computers.<br />
                         The following guidelines apply:<br />
                         4.1.2 <u>CA FACE</u><br />
                         The CA face is the way in which the bank presents facilities to be approved to a borrower. The blocks on the CA face are explained in the footnotes to the CA form in the &quot;Forms/Checklists&quot; section of this Manual. In addition, the CA face should indicate:<br />
                         1. Whether the borrower is a Target Market name or not and its tier.<br />
                         2. Exchange rates used for conversion of fine amounts to dollars.<br />
                         3. Outstandings (if any) against existing or proposed credit lines.<br />
                         4. Pricing for each facility.<br />
                         5. Also where we are recommending sub-allocations, indicate procedural guidelines on tenor and amounts. In the case of overdraft facilities, clean-up requirements (if any) should be indicated.<br />
                         6. A list of documentation requirements.<br />
                         The security documents should be listed separately from the support documents as the two have a different legal implication on the credit. After listing the do should include a statement e has reviewed the documents and that in order. Where certain documents are being deferred, appropriate credit committee approval should be obtained before any drawdown is made.<br />
                         7. The face of the CA should be used for approval of all Initial, Interim, as well as Annual Credit reviews.<br />
                         4.1.3 <u>FACILITY LISTING</u><br />
                         This is a continuation page for describing the facilities if they do not fit on the CA face.<br />
                         4.1.4 <u>CA REMARKS</u><br />
                         CA Remarks will be required for all packages and should cover the following subject matter:<br />
                         4.1.5 <u>PURPOSE/LINE STRUCTURE</u><br />
                         Since it is already obvious from the CA face what the purpose of the CA is, provide only a short statement to define the purpose of this CA (annual, interim). What should be expressly covered under this section is the purpose of the facility and justification that the proposed fine structure is appropriate for the client's need. In situations where we recommend sub-allocations, this section should provide a justification for the sub-allocation. Also include here the previous year's utilization and comment on whether it was overly or marginally used.<br />
                         4.1.6 <u>FACILITY LISTING</u><br />
                         For initial reviews, a detailed background should be provided, but we should avoid repeating information already provided on the BIR. In addition, this section should discuss the bank's relationship with the client and how we stand in the banking line up against our competition. Include here also the previous calendar progress against budget. A comment on how the company fares against the RAAC and its standing in the Bank’s portfolio quality rating is also helpful.<br />
                         4.1.7 <u>MANAGEMENT</u><br />
                         The CA remarks should contain an assessment as to management capabilities/quality. Significant changes during the past year, and anticipated major changes in Management should also be discussed in this section. Cross-reference to the BIR, if necessary, should be made.<br />
                         4.1.8 <u>FINANCIAL ANALYSIS</u><br />
                         Where a separate financial memo is not prepared, this section should give the credit committee an in-depth overall picture of the company's financial performance, its balance sheet strengths and weaknesses and its cash generating capabilities. The focus should be on the &quot;whys&quot; of the historical figures: the absolute changes are self-evident from the spreads. A fine by fine review is not necessary, but it is essential to explain major trends in the operating results, balance sheet and cash flows. An element of practical common sense must be applied, which distinguishes regular features in financial statements from either one time or irregular developments/trends. For instance, the borrower may have embarked on a CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) programme during the year under review. How this was financed, whether the programme costs are on target, and the effects of depreciation, tax liabilities, etc. should be explained. Similarly, if the receivables or inventory evidence a slip from past levers or if Short Term Debt or payables show a significant variation, these should be explained. If margin have improved or worsened (price controls, competition, one time rationalizing, restructuring of expenses) these should also be addressed. Company trends versus industry trends should also be compared. These are only a few examples. Sensitivity analysis of key balance sheet or P &amp; L items should be covered. Where security for the loan is a charge over the company's assets (floating, fixed or both), the analysis should be complemented with a liquidation analysis providing the realizable value of such assets.<br />
                         2. For classified names, there should be emphasis on specific action plans and target dates.<br />
                         4.1.9 <u>FUTURE PROSPECTS/SENSITIVITIES</u><br />
                         For the larger CAs, a paragraph covering future prospects should be included immediately after the financial analysis Section. This section should discuss the borrower's business and financial outlook over the next 12-18 months (or the life of the term loan if relevant). A critical assessment of the company's business can then be made by employing different basic assumptions (adverse political changes, sudden curtailment of import licences for raw material purchase, a shift in consumer demands, price decontrol, etc) and the resultant impact on aspects such as cash, net income and the balance sheet. A conclusion of this analysis would indicate whether such an eventuality would result in our working away from the relationship, reducing our exposure or otherwise.<br />
                         4.1.10 <u>RISKS ANALYSIS/WAYS OUT</u><br />
                         1. This is a very important part of the CA Remarks and must draw from both historical and projected results to determine specific vulnerabilities of a specific borrower, and why the risks are acceptable or not. As a general rule, each loan will have at a minimum, two ways out: the first one being the company's cash flow generation, the second one being exercising rights on the security.<br />
                         2. A very clear statement on the number of ways out should be made to determine how the risks are hedged. A comment on market value and solvability of security is desirable. Where we have a charge over assets, the analysis should also include a liquidation analysis, which takes into account a conservative and realisable market value of the assets.<br />
                         This section should also specifically address all the risks associated with the borrower, as well as the industry and then address all the mitigants. History is usually the best example of a company's ability to cope with the future and to the extent that they have failed or succeeded in the past, we can draw some conclusions on the future. Every borrower has weaknesses. We must analyze these objectively. Risk could be internal (micro: management, financial structure, poor product quality, outdated technology etc.) or external (macro: price controls/declining market demand, credit ceilings, supply, distribution, import controls, etc.). We have to decide which are the ones that apply in a specific case and the degree of vulnerability.<br />
                         4.1.11 <u>STRATEGY AND RECOMMENDATION</u><br />
                         1. Finally, the analysis of all the above must translate into specific credit recommendations indicating purpose and whether the recommendations are consistent with the risk and the client's needs.<br />
                         2. Specific line recommendations, must also be consistent with an overall relationship strategy which could be one of three – stay, increase exposure or work-away (usually applies to no T.M. names or classified IIs and worse). For classified credits, the recommendation should provide action plan, triggers and target dates.<br />
                         4.1.12 <u>BASIC INFORMATION REPORTS (BIRs)</u><br />
                         The BIR is intended to be a compressed but comprehensive profile on the borrower, and should communicate to the reader all essential facts. All blocks should be completed in as much accurate and relevant detail as possible. The BIR should contain a factual information on management/key decision makers (i.e. age, number of years with the company, previous experience) whereas the CA Remarks should highlight changes over the year, eg. key position changes, introduction of critical management process, etc; As much relevant continuing data is possible (on management, or products) should be loaded onto the BIR.<br />
                         4.1.13 <u>SPREADS</u><br />
                         1. Guidelines on the use of the spread sheets are provided in the Forms/Formats Section of this Manual. Financial reports should be obtained for all clients who are required to produce audited statements on their operations. For Ecobank purposes, these should be current and spread (even where we are not required to analyse them – e.g. cash collaterals/SBLCs type exposure).<br />
                         2. Spreads should always cover a three year period on the same form. Separate spreads should be used for projections, if applicable. Likewise, spreads of unaudited accounts should be analysed separately from those of audited statements.<br />
                         3. Use comparable periods only, but if house figures are available as of an interim date, these should be inserted into the fourth column. Do separate spreads comparing historical interims – if you need to explain any running rate differences, these should be discussed in the Remarks. If interims are not available in sufficient detail so as to be spread, then just discuss highlights.<br />
                         4.1.14 <u>MARKETING PLAN</u><br />
                         This should be used for all accounts that are expected to yield a minimum Account Profitability as defined in the target Market study. When used, it is important to ensure that marketing and credit strategies are consistent with overall relationship outlook, i.e. the specific action plans are of measurable dimensions (eg. Increase share of pool to X per cent or improve tier position by increasing or establishing facilities XYZ etc.). The Marketing Plan should, at a minimum, discuss the next 12 months. The form should be supplemented by a Budget form, discussing the various assumptions for the Budget. A sample Marketing Plan and a Budget Form are contained in the Forms and Formats Section of this Manual.<br />
                         4.1.15 <u>CHECKLISTS</u><br />
                         1. RAAC (Risk Asset Acceptance Criteria)<br />
                         This checklist focuses on the Target Market and Risk Asset Acceptance parameters.<br />
                         2. Credit Administration<br />
                         This form serves to confirm that all the necessary components of the credit package have been included. Additionally, it should be used as a self-check when the CA is still in draft form, to confirm that the key issues in each process block have been addressed.<br />
                         3. Documentation<br />
                         In addition to listing all the documents on the CA, this checklist should be completed, and reviewed by the Account Officer, Credit Department Head an the Credit Committee (for approval of deferrals).<br />
                         4.1.16 CIRCULATION OF THE CREDIT PACKAGE FOR CREDIT COMMITTEE REVIEW<br />
                         1. Each credit Committee member reviewing the CA document should set out any observations he has to make in a memo to the Account Officer. The Account Officer will thereafter finalize the package, taking into account all the points made and agreed on by the Credit Committee members.<br />
                         4.1.17 <u>POST CLASSIFICATION CAs</u><br />
                         When an account becomes adversely classified, the entire relationship must be reviewed in the form of a CA which will also require next higher level of approval. Provided the last CA was done 6 months before the classification, it will be sufficient to reproduce all the attachments to the previous CA, along with CA remarks covering the following points:<br />
                         - Relationship History and Background<br />
                         - Comments on Financial and/or Industry trends leading to the classification.<br />
                         - Existing Lines and Outstandings<br />
                         - Revision Date<br />
                         - Security/Support<br />
                         - Accrual Status (if overdue state amount and how long overdue)<br />
                         - Principal Payment status<br />
                         - Action Plan and Strategy: Must be specific and geared towards remedial management; must address whether unit plans to retain or cut (liquidation) the relationship, reasons, time frames.<br />
                         4.1.18 <u>TERM LOAN REVIEWS</u><br />
                         Where the unit has extended a term loan to the customer, the repayment program usually runs into several years with sometimes no repayments during the first two years during the grace period. In these situations, however, the relationship will still require a term loan review which will provide an update on the progress of the project, compliance with term loan covenants, changes in the Management or project structure and update on collection of principal and interest. The term loan review requires the original level of approval.<br />
                         4.1.19 <u>SAMPLES – SECTION FIVE</u><br />
                         Term Loan Summary<br />

                         1. Where withdrawals are authorized against uncollected funds, there is a potential exposure for the bank in the event that an instrument is returned unpaid while we have already advanced the customer some funds under the expected payment.<br />
                         2. Similarly, whenever the Bank issues bonds or guarantees to third parties, unless these are supported by 100% cash collateral; there is a potential credit risk which should be addressed before the issuance of such guarantees. As a rule, all guarantees should be 100% secured by cash collateral or alternatively, a corresponding secured credit line.<br />
                         3. The following CA preparation guidelines will apply:<br />
                         1. CA face and brief remarks<br />
                         2. BIR<br />
                         3. Marketing Plan<br />
                         4. Audited accounts for all corporate names should be requested.<br />
                         5. Where feasible bank checkings should be obtained from drawee's banks (i.e. where funds are regularly received from the same source).<br />
                         6. Recourse Agreements approved by legal counsel and signed by authorised signatories are required for all cheque purchase lines.<br />
                         7. Guarantees are generally 100% cash collateralized but where such cover is not available, a full risk analysis must be performed.<br />
                         8. Facilities must be reviewed annually.<br />
                         9. The Customer Service Unit must be provide with a copy of the approval CA face.<br />

                         1. Credit packages recommending policy loans should contain a CA with a remarks section. The remarks page should cover:<br />
                         - Purpose/line structure<br />
                         - Relationship Background<br />

                         - Recommendation<br />
                         2. A policy loan is defined as a loan made to:<br />
                         - An individual (except a staff member)<br />
                         - To an entity where the proprietorship is used essentially for personal<br />
                         accommodation.<br />
                         3. The following procedural guidelines will apply:<br />
                         - All Policy loans must carry the full credit Committee approval<br />
                         including the Managing Director.<br />
                         - Borrowers will be confined to individuals associated with Tier I Group<br />

                         - Amounts must not exceed the equivalent of US $50,000<br />
                         - Tenor must not exceed three (3) years; because of this,<br />
                         - Real estate loans are specifically excluded from the Personal loans<br />
                         program.<br />
                         4. All exceptions to the above will require the approval of the Chairman of the Subsidiary/affiliate concerned and ETI-CPC. In addition, once a year as of December 31, the Bank must prepare a summary of all outstanding Policy loans and submit the summary to the Bank’s Board of Directors for review The report should be in the following format and must be submitted by January 31 of following year.<br />

           <strong id="s4.4"><a name="s4.4">4.4 </a><u> CREDIT PACKAGES – FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</u></strong><br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><u>OVERVIEW</u></strong><br />
                         4.4.1 Lending to Banks/Financial Institutions involves different considerations to lending to commercial customers.<br />
                         For a start an evaluation of the banking sectors and a rating or tiering of individual institutions needs to be done.<br />
                         4.4.2 The following general considerations apply:<br />
                         1. The risks faced by banks in any given country are influenced by the structure of the banking system, the competence of its regulators, and the objectives of political leaders.<br />
                         2. The risk of lending to a government-owned bank is similar to country risk.<br />
                         3. A retail bank is one which has a broad base of depositors and risk assets diversified among thousands of separate unrelated obligors.<br />
                         4. A bank which has refund itself with “bought money” does not have the same stable deposit base as a retail bank. And the regulatory authority may not be as willing to step in as a lender of last resort.<br />
                         5. A bank in an exchange control country which borrows in foreign currency is dependent upon the monetary authority’s willingness and ability to make exchange available for repayment. It also has an exchange risk.<br />
                         6. Specialised banks, merchant banks, investment banks, consortia, especially if foreign-owned, are rarely integrated into the host country’s economy and may not enjoy the support of the local regulator to the same extent as purely domestic banks.<br />
                         7. A healthy parent-bank will tend to support a weak subsidiary, especially if it bears its name. When the roles are reversed and the parent has a problem, the subsidiary can be affected adversely.<br />
                         4.4.3 Specific country factors and banking policies must also be considered.<br />
                         1. Economic and political stability of the country. In some instances, the ultimate risk of credit to banks will in fact be the ability of a sovereign state to assure liquidity of its key institutions.<br />
                         2. Position and reputation of the bank in the economy. (for instance, a state owned Bank will probably be supported by the Central Bank in case of trouble).<br />
                         3. Quality of management (i.e. professional competence, level of professional experience, familiarity with their bank, MIS availability? technologically up to date?, soundness of policies?).<br />
                         4. Quality of assets: loan loss reserve policy; write-off experience, portfolio diversification in terms of exposure by industry, geography, maturity.<br />
                         5. Earnings: where known, it may be appropriate to pull some meaningful ratios such as earnings/capital, loan loss coverage, earnings to risk assets, etc. Historical track record should be assessed.<br />
                         6. Liquidity, defined as a bank’s ability to repay depositors, is a key element in the qualitative evaluation of a bank because of the rapidly shifting character of a bank’s assets and liabilities. A bank must maintain sufficient reserves to meet deposit swings, both daily and seasonal, long-term deposit trends and customer loan demand. With the increasingly active participation of banks in the major money markets has come the need to assess their ability to acquire funds under varying conditions of stress. It is important to understand the extent to which a bank relies on borrowed funds.<br />
                         7. Capital and capital adequacy regulations and the extent to which they are being complied with.<br />

           <strong id="s4.7"><a name="s4.7">4.7 </a><u>AVAILMENT/OFFERING TICKETS</u></strong><br />
                         4.7.1 <u>AVAILMENT TICKET</u><br />
                         Under normal process guidelines, the Bank will prepare a credit package, take it through all approval steps and obtain all the necessary documentation before releasing the line for customer use. If this has been accomplished, and provided that the same product, limits, and the tenors approved in the CA are being availed, then the disbursement, whether done in the loans department, over the counter represents an availment. For transactions other than availments under facilities for advances in current account, an availment ticket (AT) will be prepared for securing approvals in accordance with the guidelines in Section One of this Manual.<br />
                         4.7.2 <u>OFFERING TICKET</u><br />
                         In exceptional situations, the bank may be requested to do a one-off transaction where production of a full CA package would not be warranted. For such situations, the processing of the disbursement can be on an offering basis, and an offering ticket (OT) can be prepared for securing the necessary approval as per Section One of this Manual. OT approval is also appropriate if credit facilities have been approved, but not all conditions have been complied with.<br />
                         4.7.3 <u>ROUTING</u><br />
                         1. Except for overdrafts (where an availment ticket is done for the line not for individual debits), all disbursement requests should be routed through operating departments who will review the request and prepare a ticket describing the proposed transaction.<br />
                         2. This ticket, along with supporting documents will be passed to the Credit Administration Department, which will indicate the approved lines, and present outstandings and whether the documentation is complete and in order. The Credit Department will also state whether or not the transaction is within lines and pass the ticket to the Account Officer.<br />
                         3. The Account Officer will confirm the pricing for the transaction, obtain necessary Credit Committee approval and (in the case of OTs) indicate time frame for correcting the irregularities on the transaction (eg. formalising the transaction as a facility, obtaining missing documentation, etc….).<br />
                         4. The Account officer will pass the ticket to the Credit Administration Department which will confirm that the approvals are regular and return the tickets to the Operating Department for processing.<br />
                         5. After processing, the Operating Department should photocopy each ticket and pass on a copy (if this is an AT) to the Credit Administration Department against the proper initials. In the case of OTs originals will be kept by the Credit Administration Department, while the Operating Department will keep a copy, also initialled by the Credit Administration Department.<br />
                         For ease of reference by Customer service and other Operating . Departments, copies of all approved CAs and any amendments thereof should be made available to all such units.<br />

                         A sample Availment Ticket and description is contained in Chapter Five of this Manual.<br />
                         <strong id="s4.8"><a name="s4.8">4.8 </a><u>INTEREST EARNED NOT COLLECTED</u></strong><br />
                         1. Interest earned on advances in current account may be debited to the customer’s account to create a TOD (Temporary Overdraft) provided that the excess over the approved line is liquidated within 7 days. If after a period of 30 days from original booking date this TOD is not liquidated, it should be reversed out of income (i.e. crediting Interest Earned not Collected and debiting Profit and Loss – Adjustments and Refunds of Profits Previously Taken).<br />
                         2. With regard to interest on temporary overdrafts, since TODs by definition are temporary and should be cleared within 7 days, interest on TODs may be debited to the customer’s account, but if principal is unpaid after 90 days, the TOD should be transferred to non-accrual and interest accrual reversed out of income.<br />

           <strong id="s4.9"><a name="s4.9">4.9. </a><u>PAST DUE OBLIGATIONS - NON ACCRUAL ASSETS</u></strong><br />
                         4.9.1 <u>SCHEDULE FOR TRANSFER OF ASSETS TO PAST DUE OBLIGATIONS</u><br />
                         Loans and Advances: These assets are transferred to PDO according to the following schedule:<br />
                         1. Single payment loans that are unpaid 15 days after maturity.<br />
                         2. Single payment loans and demand notes with interest payable at stated intervals where an interest payment is due and unpaid for 15 days. When an interest payment is past due, the entire unpaid principal must be transferred to Past Due Obligations.<br />
                         3. An instalment that is unpaid (principal or interest) for 30 days on consumer, mortgage, or term corporate instalment loans. When an instalment is past due, the entire unpaid balance must be transferred to Past Due Obligations.<br />
                         4. Casual overdrafts not paid within 15 days. Overdrafts extended under formal lines are considered past due when not covered per the terms of the underlying agreement or in any event 15 days after the line has expired.<br />
                         5. Advances under Letters of Credit: Any outstanding items exceeding 30 days will be transferred to PDO automatically by the Operating Department.<br />
                         6. Bills Negotiated: Cheques purchased will be transferred to PDO if they remain unpaid for 30 days.<br />
                         7. Bills Discounted: Will be treated as single payment loans.<br />
                         4.9.2 <u>RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIQUIDATION OF PAST DUE OBLIGATIONS</u><br />
                         1. Where a new PDO is created, it is the responsibility of the Account Officer to ensure follow-up to obtain liquidation.<br />
                         2. The impact of the creation of a PDO item on an account relationship should result in our taking a close look as to continued accommodation although as a general rule no further credit, irrespective of lines, will be permitted until the PDO item is liquidated and only then after full Credit Committee’s approval.<br />
                         4.9.3 <u>TRANSFER TO NON-ACCRUAL STATUS</u><br />
                         If interest and/or principal remains unpaid for a period of 90 days from the date due (and not from date of transfer to PDO), all outstandings to the borrower should be transferred to PDO - Non Accrual and all unpaid interest reversed out immediately to the debit of Profit and Loss - Adjustments and Refunds of Profits Previously Taken. The entire asset should be transferred to PDO Non Accrual and not just the unpaid instalment.<br />
                         When an outstanding is classified III previously accrued and unpaid interest must be reversed out as under ( i ) above.<br />
                         4.9.4 <u>PAYMENTS ON PAST DUE ITEMS</u><br />
                         The following guidelines will apply:<br />
                         1. Past Due Obligation, on accrual, not reserved against. Payments received are to be applied as follows:<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Outstanding interest firs.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Then principal after all interest cleared.<br />
                         2. PDO, on accrual, partly or wholly reserved against:<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. payments specifically tendered by client as interest will be applied first to interest, then to principal.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. if no specific application mentioned by client, then funds to be applied first to principal and,<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. after all principal is paid, additional amounts will be applied to interest.<br />
                         3. PDO, on non-accrual, whether reserved against or not. Payment applications will be in the order given:<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Principal.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. After all principal repaid, then additional funds to interest.<br />
                         4. Items written off and only a claim record is maintained.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. First application to principal.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. After all principal is repaid, then application to memo interest.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. All funds applied to interest, in the case of non-accrual PDOs and claims should be credited to Profit &amp; Loss Sub-division Adjustment and Refunds of profits Previously Taken only to the extent that IENC was originally reversed out to the debit of Profit &amp; Loss. Memo interest over and above this out-off should be credited to Interest and Discount.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Whenever doubts exist, applications of funds received against PDOs on accrual, will be referred to the Credit Committee and Managing Director.<br />
                         4.9.5 <u>REPORTING</u><br />
                         The Credit Administration Department Head will report to the Credit Committee and the Managing Director as of each calendar month end, all PDOs outstanding. The report should indicate Name, Amount, Number of days outstanding, and the Account Officer's action plan &quot;to get the past due obligations regularised. The Board of Directors will be kept informed of PDO outstandings on a quarterly basis, and monthly if any PDO item exceeds US$250,000 (or its equivalent in local -currency) or is classified IA or worse.<br />

                         4.10.1 <u>CANCELLATION/FREEZING OF LINES</u><br />
                         Any cancellation or freezing of fines, should not be instituted without formal notice to the borrower. A unilateral decision in this regard, if not communicated to the borrower, may expose us to litigation brought against us by the borrower.<br />
                         4.10.2 <u>CLOSING OF CURRENT ACCOUNTS</u><br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Before a current account is closed, reasonable notice must be given to the customers so that they can make alternative arrangements.<br />
                         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. All officers are asked to ensure strict compliance as negligence on the part of the Bank could prove to be very costly.<br /><strong>
                         <a name="s4.11">4.11 </a><u>CENTRAL LIABILITY RECORDS</u></strong><br />
                         4.11.1 Unless or until the Bank transaction processing is automated, the Credit Administration Department will be responsible for the maintenance of accurate and up-to-date Central Liability records.<br />
                         4.11.2 <u>DEFINITION</u><br />
                         A Central Liability ledger is a ledger card where each customer’s direct and indirect obligations are recorded.<br />
                         4.11.3 <u>PROCEDURE</u><br />
                         1. All borrowing customers’ direct and indirect obligations must be controlled against the relative approved credit lines and commitments.<br />
                         2. Even if borrowers' obligations are not supported by credit fines, these should still be recorded on a ledger card with notation to indicate &quot;No Line&quot; or &quot;Approved on OT&quot; basis or otherwise.<br />
                         3. Foreign currency obligations will be recorded in the currency of the obligations and converted into local currency (et prevailing exchange rate) for reporting purposes wherever a report is required. For bills purchased and advances in current accounts, individual cards held by Customer Service Unit will be used in lieu of Central Liability Ledgers. Please note that the latter outstandings are not reflected in Central Liability ledgers.<br />
                         4. One ledger card will be maintained for all products/obligations (including sublimits). A customer with five different products will have all his outstandings recorded on one card.<br />
                         5. When reporting outstandings on an availment or offering ticket, care must be taken to ensure that all of the borrower's outstandings in the various cards including Customer Service records have been picked up to arrive at the total outstandings figure.<br />

                         4.12.1 The objective of this section is to provide a description of the more common banking products. This guideline will help the writer/reviewer of a credit to ensure that each credit line is fully described giving tenor, maximum period, sublimit provisions, etc.<br />
                         4.12.2 The following are standardized line descriptions which may be used for short-term facilities. When lesser risks are to be included in a line (e.g. sight L/Cs, under acceptance L/Cs), use the line description of the greater risk rather than “and/or” descriptions. When the purpose of the line is not exactly described, select that description most closely approximating your risk, making sure your risk is equal to, or less than that of the selected description.<br />
                         1. For advances in current account.<br />

           <strong id="s4.14"><a name="s4.14">4.14 </a><u>CREDIT FACILITIES TO THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS RELATED AGENCIES</u></strong><br />
                         4.14.1 Whenever credit facilities are being extended to the Gorvernment, or to any of the majority owned or controlled Agencies, inclulding state owned or controlled banks, a determination must be made as to whether the entity meets<br />
                         the “Means and purpose Test” for supporting the credit request or whether such credit will be consolidated with the credit risk of the Government. This definition results in breaking up of credit extension to Government sectors into two distinct categories:<br />
                         4.14.2 <u>CATEGORY I</u><br />
                         Credit extended to Government entities which do not satisfy the means and purpose test and whose borrowing has to be aggregated with other lending to the Government.<br />
                         4.14.3 <u>CATEGORY II</u><br />
                         In order to recognize a Government entity being in category II (stand-alone entity), the following criteria must be satisfied:<br />
                         The borrower must have its own resources or revenue sufficient, to service its obligations over time (Means Test). The loan must be obtained for a purpose consistent with the borrower's general business (Purpose Test).<br />
                         4.14.3 <u>DOCUMENTATION</u><br />
                         There are five specific documents that must be maintained in the credit files in order to show that loans or other extensions of credit meet the means and purpose test. These requirements are:<br />
                         1. A statement and supporting documentation describing the legal statue and degree of financial and operational autonomy of the entity.<br />
                         2. Financial statements for the three years preceding initial extension of credit.<br />
                         3. Financial statements for each year that facilities are outstanding.<br />
                         4. A detailed assessment of the entity’s means of servicing the loan.<br />
                         5. A loan agreement or other written statement from the borrower which clearly describes the purpose of the credit facilities.<br />
                         4.14.5 The best way to ensure that this is complied with is to have a copy of this section put at the beginning of the CA section of every credit file for which this is a consideration.<br />
                         2. With the above guidelines, the lending unit should be able to readily identify and incorporate the facilities either as belonging to category I or II of the Government CAs.<br />
                         4.14.6 All facilities to Category I names will be approved in- the name of the Government and its Agencies. Facilities to Category II names will be approved in separate individual CAs, but all approved amounts must be included under Category II of the Government CA for reporting purposes. Facilities to Category I names must have a common review date but those of Category II will be reviewed on dates which coincide with their annual statement dates. Category II names will be shown on the Government CA for information purposes only, but should not be added to the total of that CA for approval purposes.<br />

                         1. With some problem credits where a protracted work out is anticipated, where the principal amount is wholly or partially reserved or likely to be reserved in the near future, and when the legal, opportunity and carrying costs are high, it may be worthwhile to negotiate a compromise settlement with a borrower. Such compromise settlements may include the foregoing of part or all of interest and even part of principal.<br />
                         2. Any form of compromise settlement or moratorium on principal or interest (accrued or memo) requires approval at the same lever of credit authority as would be required if the total relationship were adversely classified.<br />
                         3. The Board of the operating unit and ETI-CPC must be consulted for any such transaction in excess of US$ 50,000 before a commitment is made. Similarly, for amounts in excess of US$ 250,000, the Board of ETI must be consulted. In either case, once approved, the Audit Division of ETI must be promptly advised.<br />
                         4.15.1 <u>ABANDONMENT OF RECOVERY EFFORTS</u><br />
                         Decision to abandon recovery efforts must be taken by the Credit Committee, including the Managing Director for amounts up to US$ 5,000. For amounts exceeding US$ 5,000 but not exceeding US$ 50,000 approval by the Board of Directors must be obtained. Amounts in excess of the operating unit of US$ 50,000 but not exceeding US$ 250,000 should be referred for approval to ETI-CPC and amounts in excess of $250,000 to the Board of ETI.<br />

                         1. The Risk Asset Review (RAR) procedures are an integral part of the credit management process of ECOBANK. Risk Asset Review’s mission is two-fold:<br />
                         - To conduct an independent examination of the credit health of a business unit’s portfolio and the risk asset management process, and<br />
                         - To report to management and the Board of Directors of ETI, through the Chief Auditor, the results of such examinations.<br />
                         2. Risk Asset Reviews are conducted on an annual basis and the scope of the review must cover all of the subsidiary's risk assets.<br />
                         4.17.1 <u>REVIEW GUIDELINES</u><br />

                         4.17.2 <u>PRE-AUDIT PREPARATIONS</u><br />
                         Prior to the arrival of the reviewers, the Bank must prepare a package for the auditors covering the following items:<br />
                         4.17.3 <u>PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION AND STATISTICS</u><br />

                         - Details of all contingent outstandings.<br />
                         - A copy of the General Ledger.<br />
                         4.17.4 <u>PERSONNEL RELATED MATERIAL</u><br />
                         - The Bank's organization chart.<br />
                         - List of account officers (credit officers) biographical data.<br />
                         - Account assignment list.<br />

                         - Summary of credit training programs for the current and coming year for the credit and marketing staff.<br />
                         4.17.5 <u>OTHER/REPORTS</u><br />
                         - If prior reviews have been conducted, a copy of the lest risk asset review report, lest operations inspection report and (if any) lest Central Bank inspection report.<br />
                         - If the Bank has any classified portfolio, copies of the classified loan reports for the lest six months should be provided.<br />
                         - A copy of the Bank's plan/strategy paper and Target Market Study.<br />
                         - A list of all past due obligations as of out-off date.<br />

                         - A list of the 10 most profitable accounts, including lest full year account profits or current year to date account profits.<br />
                         - A list of all deals turned clown during the year.<br />
                         4.17.6 <u>APPROACH TO THE AUDIT</u><br />
                         1. The Audit team normally advises their proposed arrival well in advance and sometimes may request that the review package be forwarded to them (in the Hotel) a few days before review date usually the week-end before. Upon arrival at the Bank the Auditors normally hold discussions with the Bank Management to understand the business environment, regulatory restrictions, exchange controls, lending ceilinc3s, etc. Other issues covered include competition, ECOBANK market share and unit's business plan.<br />
                         2. After these discussions, the reviewers then proceed with a review of credit files and this exercise brings out strengths as well as weaknesses both in the credit process as well as the portfolio. All the files are reviewed against the process cycle blocks of Target Market, Credit Initiation, Documentation and Disbursement, Credit Administration, Problem Recognition, Policy, Practice and Procedures, Remedial Management and Organization/Staffing. A checklist of some of the questions asked is included in Chapter Five of this Manual.<br />
                         4.17.7 <u>POST REVIEW</u><br />
                         After completion of the review, the Auditors will give the Branch a rating on both the portfolio quality as well as the process quality. These ratings vary from above acceptable to acceptable, below acceptable and unsatisfactory in descending order of merit.<br />
                         4.17.8 <u>FOLLOW-THROUGH ON REVIEW</u><br />
                         1. Often, the review will surface a number of weaknesses either in the main process or specifically related to some accounts. Additionally, the reviewers may make recommendations which need to be incorporated within existing systems and controls.<br />
                         2. To ensure that all these are addressed within a reasonable time-frame, the comments and recommendations are put on a corrective grid which describes the comments and identifies the necessary individual or department to carry out the necessary corrective action. This grid is subsequently reviewed in future process meetings and all deficiencies have to be corrected before the next audit. Repeat comments are a serious affair and every effort has to be made to avoid them. </p>
