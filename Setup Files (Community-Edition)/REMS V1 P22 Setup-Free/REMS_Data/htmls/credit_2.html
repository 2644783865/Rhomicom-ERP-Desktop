                  <a name="s2.1">2.1 </a><u>TARGET MARKET/RISK ASSET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA</u><br />
                  2.1.1 <u>GENERAL</u></strong><br />
                  The target market and risk asset selection is a continuous process which involves a screening of the entire market, identifying business potential, defining desirable opportunities and adhering to resultant marketing objectives and strategies. An unfocused approach to the market can-lead to unplanned asset concentrations of uneven quality on the books, and it may not be possible for the Bank to easily work out from undesirable relationships even when such a decision has been made.<br />
                  2.1.2 <u>SURVEYS</u><br />
                  This entails a screening of the market and economic sectors to identify key players and potential business for the Bank. This is followed by a short listing of the desirable industries. This list should be supported by a justification as to why only some industries were selected, and why the Bank will not deal with some others.<br />
                  2.1.3 <u>INDUSTRY STUDIES</u><br />
                  These should be carried out on each of the selected industries. This exercise will enable the Branch to understand the importance of each sector to the economy, Gross Domestic Product percentage share, key players in the industry, business cycles and product mix. The information derived above guides the Bank in identifying critical success factors and quantitative/qualitative acceptance parameters by industry.<br />
                  2.1.4 <u>RISK ASSET ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (RAAC)</u><br />
                  Workable and appropriate Risk Asset Acceptance Criteria (RAAC) have to be developed for each industry, taking into account both quantitative as well as qualitative parameters identified above. Example of these include, net sales, net income, years in business, market reputation, management quality, minimum lending, ... among others.<br />
                  2.1.5 <u>PRODUCT RISK ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (PRAC)</u><br />
                  Differing financing needs for the different industries often make it necessary to identify the credit products mostly required by each industry. Such products should be supported by a product RAAC which evidences that tenor, documentation requirements and approval process are consistent with the associated transaction risks and that transaction flows are understood and documented.<br />
                  2.1.6 <u>PROSPECT LISTS</u><br />
                  Since each industry study will have brought out a list of all the main players, a customer / prospect list will be developed taking into account the minimum acceptance parameters for the industry as well as each individual customer. The list will indicate a ranking in preference i.e. tier I customers would be the priority names, tier II would be acceptable names and tier III being acceptable if properly structured and secured. All work-away name, personal policy loans and classified accounts will be considered tier IV or exception to the target market.<br />
                  2.1.7 <u>ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENTS</u><br />
                  This is a process of assigning a list of accounts (both customers and prospects) to each Account Officer. The account load must take into consideration the human resources available and their relative experience.<br />
                  2.1.8 <u>REPORTING</u><br />
                  a) Once a year the unit must review the entire portfolio and confirm that all the names are properly tiered against the established risk asset criteria. Names falling out of this tiering should be posted into a Non-Target list and appropriate recommendations made (with time frames) for either pulling them back into acceptable risk assets or working away from the relationship. This list will require annual approval by the Board of Directors.<br />
                  b) Target Market update: A comprehensive update will be carried out once a year and semi-annual update may be considered if there have been major developments in the market or the economy during the year.<br />
                  2.1.9 <u>HOUSE-KEEPING CONTROLS</u><br />
                  Except for personal or policy loans, all CA's must be accompanied by a duly completed RAAC checklist and any deviations to the minimum requirements must be highlighted for BBC approval. Additionally, each CA face must indicate whether or not the borrower is a target market name and if so, the tiering category.<br />
                  2.1.10 <u>SAMPLES</u><br />
                  Please refer to Section Five of this Manual for samples of:<br />
                  - TM/RAAC checklist<br />
                  - Product RAAC<br />
                  - Credit Administration checklist<br />
                  <a name="s2.2">2.2 </a><strong id="s2.2"><u>CREDIT INITIATION</u></strong><br />
                  This process covers the evaluation, analysis and approval of individual credit facilities. Credit initiation includes new extensions of credit, incremental risk, restructuring and/or annual review of previously approved facilities. The process calls for full information gathering, together with financial and risk analysis leading up to the approval decision.<br />
                  Analysis and standards vary according to business product, market, transaction characteristics and environmental issues, and good judgement should always be made in ensuring that all relevant issues have been addressed in each situation. The presentation should be in the form of a credit application accompanied by the necessary supporting information as outlined in the CA Package Guidelines in Section Three of this Manual. Other essential steps to be followed in the Credit Initiation Phase are:<br />
                  2.2.1 <u>CUSTOMER SOLICITATION</u><br />
                  The primary source of customers should be the prospect list developed in the Target Market exercise. Contact with potential customers can be by way of our approaching the company directly, referrals from our existing customers or business contacts, referrals from other banks, or customers approaching us directly, either in writing or by visiting the Bank.<br />
                  2.2.2 <u>NEGOTIATION</u><br />
                  Once a customer's credit needs have been gathered, the account officer must obtain the necessary background information on the company, financials for at least the lest three years, and in the case of term loans, project details and projections for the life of the loan. Even before a thorough financial analysis has been undertaken, a quick review, backed by our understanding of the industry and our ranking of the customers on the Target Market list will give the Bank a clear indication of whether this will be an acceptable risk or not. Some considerations in this regard would include risk/reward ratio, documentation and our ability to accommodate the customer's financing needs.<br />
                  Senior Management must always be consulted before giving firm indications to the customer and all discussions should be documented in a comprehensive initial call memorandum. On a selective basis, letters of interest may be issued. Such letters must be carefully worded and must clearly state that the letter of interest does not constitute a commitment for the Bank at this point. A sample letter of interest is presented in section Five of this Manual. Only the Managing Director or his alternates under specific delegation may sign letters of interest.<br />
                  2.2.3 <u>PRESENTATION</u><br />
                  If the initial screening and discussions with the client reveal that the client fits our target parameters, the Account Officer should then spread all the financial statements and prepare a comprehensive credit package for review and approval. CA preparation guidelines are further discussed in Section Three of this Manual. In addition to the information received from the borrower, the Account Officer should obtain Bank and Trade checkings on the borrower to enable him to independently verify all the information and statements made by the borrower. Note that extreme caution must be taken when conducting initial discussions with the client so that no commitment is made, or received to be made until all the necessary credit approvals are in place.<br />
                  2.2.4 <u>CREDIT COMMITTEE REVIEW/APPROVAL</u><br />
                  Once the draft Credit Package has been put together, the Account Officer should circulate a draft of the package to each Credit Committee member<br />
                  requesting review and comments which may need to be incorporated in the final credit. All reviewing officers should document their comments and pass these to the Account Officer. The Account Officer should then be in a position to finalise the package and obtain the necessary approvals. It should be borne in mind that Risk appraisal is an ongoing process and consideration of the impact of major developments should not be deferred until the next annual review, particularly if adverse developments occur it is important to react in a timely manner so as to protect the bank's interests in the best possible way.<br />
                  2.2.5 <u>CONTROL AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</u><br />
                  1. All credit exposures must be accurately reflected in the central liability ledger of the bank.<br />
                  2. Financial Statements must be obtained and analysed in a timely manner. Ideally statements included in CA packages should be no more than twelve months old.<br />
                  3. Updated Bank and trade checkings must be submitted with each annual review.<br />
                  4. Account and/or marketing plans (see Section 5 for examples) must be reviewed on a regular basis (at least annually).<br />
                  2.2.6 <u>ADVISE TO CUSTOMERS OF APPROVED LINES</u><br />
                  Where it is a market practice to advise customers of approved lines in writing, all such advises will be signed by the Managing Director or his alternates under specific delegation.<br />
                  Such letters must clearly state that the lines of credit are subject to periodic review and modification or cancellation at the Bank's option.<br />
                  <a name="s2.3">2.3</a><strong id="s2.3"><u> DOCUMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT</u></strong><br />
                  1. This is a critical phase of the risk management process and requires a thorough understanding of the legal practices both within the borrower’s as well as the lender’s operating environment. All documentation procedures must be tailored to afford the Bank maximum protection and if any doubts exist, Legal<br />
                  Counsel should be consulted before making any compromises with the customer. As a general rule, all legal expenses relating to a specific credit are for the borrower’s account.<br />
                  2. Wherever possible, documentation must be on standard forms and/or in standard formats which have been reviewed and approved by the Bank's Legal Counsel. Periodic reviews and amendments must be undertaken whenever appropriate to keep the documentation in fine with ever-changing legal systems and practices.<br />
                  The local Managing Director is directly accountable for all non-standard documentation. Such must be approved by him in all cases and it is his direct decision whether to obtain the approval of legal counsel.<br />
                  3. Within the Target Market exercise the unit will have identified minimum documentation requirements for each product and a checklist for documentation should already be in place. These minimum requirements should be supplemented by the general documentation requirements for all borrowing customers. Essential steps in documenting credit transactions can therefore be summarized as follows:<br />
                  2.3.1 <u>UNDERSTANDING OF LEGAL SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES</u><br />
                  Understanding of the local laws/practices. These requirements vary from one country to another and will determine the type of documentation we can request and obtain from our customers. Legal Counsel is usually the best source of information in this connection.<br />
                  2.3.2 <u>SELECTION OF LEGAL COUNSEL</u><br />
                  Reputation and standing will be the major determinants in the choice of local legal counsel. Occasionally, situations arise in which partners in law firms that represent ECOBANK also have dealings with borrowers. While it is expected that attorneys who represent us adhere to the highest professional and ethical standards, the overriding objective is to make certain that the attorney and his firm are able to apply their unbiased and independent judgement to each client's affairs. In all situations, attorneys will be expected to make a full disclosure of relationships with the Bank's clients and where the bank perceives a potential conflict of interest, the bank should select another legal adviser for these relationships. Each operating unit should maintain an approved list of Notaries and legal counsel.<br />
                  2.3.3 <u>ADEQUACY OF SECURITY</u><br />
                  Care must be taken to ensure that the transaction risk is appropriately covered by the type of security offered. As example, wherever possible, long term lending should be secured by fixed assets and/or other continuing guarantees while short term facilities may be secured by assignment of matching receivables, pledges of inventory or cash collateral deposits pledged to the Bank.<br />
                  2.3.4 <u>EXECUTION AND PERFECTION OF LEGAL DOCUMENTATION</u><br />
                  This involves the execution and proper registration of documentation, independent signature verifications and payment of stamp duty. Where documents are subject to statute of limitations, adequate controls must be put in place to review such documents prior to expiry.<br />
                  2.3.5 <u>SAFEKEEPING AND CONTROL OF LEGAL DOCUMENTATION</u><br />
                  1. Primary responsibility for safekeeping lies with the Credit Department or Legal Officer at the local level. Prior to lodgement, all documents should be reviewed and initialled by both Account Officer and Legal Counsel or Credit Department Head. Where applicable, all signatures should be independently verified by the signature clerk and other documents like guarantees should be properly witnessed. A checklist for reviewing documentation completeness should be used in reviewing each document prior to lodging (sample in Section five). The documentation cabinets should be under dual control of two designated officers.<br />
                  2. All documents should then be listed in a &quot;Documentation/ Control Card&quot;, (sample in Section Five). The form should again be initialled by Account Officer and Credit Department Head. Credit Committee approval for deferral or waiver (as appropriate) of any documents will be highlighted on the longer part of the form.<br />
                  3. The original documents will then be filed in alphabetical order (by client) in documentation folders and kept in a fire resistant cabinet in the vault. A copy of the document itself and the safekeeping receipt shall be held in the documentation section of the credit folder.<br />
                  2.3.6 <u>RELEASE/RETURN OF DOCUMENTS</u><br />
                  The back side of the Documentation Control Card is designed to allow for listing of documents both for permanent or temporary release. If documents are being released to an Account Officer for day use in the Bank, his or her initial is sufficient on the card but the documentation custodians must ensure that the documents are returned within the same day. Where documents are being released for alteration or modification to the customer, but there are outstandings on the books, full Credit Committee approval must be obtained in a memo justifying the release and every effort must be made to obtain substitute temporary security such as cash collateral. The documentation custodians should initial the card upon such release and subsequent return of documents.<br />
                  2.3.7 <u>PERIODIC REVIEW</u><br />
                  After the initial review and lodgement, both the Account Officer and Credit Department Head or Legal Officer must undertake a documentation review for completeness, a1 least once every year. Where either the Account Officer or the Legal Officer change, the outgoing and the incoming officers must jointly review all documents to confirm that they have verified existing documentation and found it in order. Additionally, Legal Counsel should review all documents at least once every two years to confirm the adequacy in light of any changes that may have taken place in the legal system since initial drawing up of the documentation. In case of adverse development and classification of credit, related documents should be immediately referred to Legal Counsel for review.<br />
                  2.3.8 <u>DOCUMENTATION OF CREDIT FACILITIES</u><br />
                  Documentation requirements for each credit facility will be decided by the Credit committee in consultation with the minimum documentation requirements laid clown by Legal Counsel. Legal Counsel must be consulted in all situations that depart from the routine guidelines. From the Group perspective the minimum documentation requirements are:<br />
                  1. Borrower must be a current account holder and must have met the necessary current account documentation requirements.<br />
                  2. Borrower must also meet the general borrowing requirements and additionally, depending on the product under consideration, meet the specific requirements for each product.<br />
                  3. The documentation requirements will form a part of the credit package and no disbursement of funds may take place until the Account Manager and Credit Department Head have confirmed to the Credit Committee (on the checklist) that all documentation is obtained and in order.<br />
                  4. Prior to being lodged for safekeeping, all documents must be independently signature verified. They should also be pencil initialled by the Account Manager and Credit Department Head and Legal Officer.<br />
                  5. In situations where disbursements are made prior to completion of documentation a procedure must be in place in the Credit Administration Department to continue following up for the receipt of outstanding documentation by the agreed Target Date. This requirement is in addition to the approvals required for deferral of documentation as contained in Section 1.4.<br />
                  2.3.9 <u>DESCRIPTION OF SECURITY AND SUPPORT ON CAs</u><br />
                  The following are guidelines for describing security/support in credit applications:<br />
                  2.3.10 <u>CHARGE OVER CURRENT ASSET</u>S<br />
                  - Indicate extent of charge over inventory or receivables-Amount of charge.<br />

                  - Value of collateral and source of valuation.<br />
                  Example: pari passu first registered charge over inventory and receivables for ………….. shared with ……………… margin of 75% on inventory and 80% on receivables. Fire insurance lodged with …………. (lead bank) and both banks noted as loss payees. Current value………. per stock and receivables statements dated………………<br />
                  2.3.11 <u>CHARGE OVER FIXED ASSETS</u><br />
                  - Whether debenture or mortgage (equitable or registered).<br />
                  - Whether first or second, shared or sole.<br />
                  - Assets covered and amount of mortgage.<br />
                  - Margins.<br />
                  - Current appraised value (no more than one year old and appraisal to be carried out by duly appointed and qualified appraiser).<br />
                  - Insurance and risks covered.<br />
                  Example: First registered debenture in favour of ECOBANK for …………………………….. over land, building and equipment valued at ……………………….. as of …………………………. Margin 40%. All risk insurance lodged with us and ECOBANK named as loss payee (held).<br />
                  2.3.12 <u>GUARANTEES</u><br />
                  - Whether personal, joint and several, cross company, parent company or third party.<br />
                  - If externally guaranteed, indicate guaranteeing entity and date guarantee received.<br />
                  - Amount and expiry date of the guarantee.<br />
                  - Indicate estimated net worth of individuals or corporate entities guaranteeing the obligation (for individuals, confirm net worth statements held or not).<br />
                  Example: Joint and several guarantees of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jon Smith (Directors of ABC Company) for …………………. Estimated net worth …………………..<br />
                  and ………………………. Respectively per Personal Means Statement dated ……………. (held).<br />

                  - Loan subordination (indicate amount and source)<br />
                  - Special approval conditions – Example: Confirmation that all conditions precedent have been met prior to disbursement.<br />
                  2.3.15 <u>BANK GUARANTEES<br />
                  Issuance</u><br />
                  1. The issuance of a guarantee will be supported by an application or counter-indemnity signed by the customer, in which the customer must agree:<br />
                  2. To reimburse the Bank for any payment made under the guarantee, regardless of whether or not the beneficiary's claim thereunder was genuinely justified.<br />
                  3. Upon demand by the Bank to provide cash (or other collateral satisfactory to the Bank) sufficient in amount to cover the Bank's total liability in the transaction (commonly known as a &quot;Cash Substitution clause&quot;).<br />
                  4. The guarantee issued will also vary depending on the specific transaction requirements, but will be worded to the extent possible in fine with the<br />
                  counter-indemnity, and in such a way as to avoid any possibility of the Bank's involvement in any dispute as to whether the principal (our customer) has indeed failed to perform his obligations under the terms of the guarantee. A place of payment, an expiry date, and a limit on amount must also be embodied in the counter-indemnity and the guarantee. As a matter of policy the instrument issued will contain a clause stating that it will be returned to the Bank when the purpose of the issuance of the instrument has been fulfilled However, this provision may be waived in the event that the guarantee text includes a clause to the effect that the bank's liability will cease on the expiry date whether or not the instrument is returned.<br />
                  5. If the Bank is liable for interest payment under the guarantee, this should be clearly incorporated in the maximum amount payable under the terms of the guarantee.<br />
                  6. In all cases, a counter-indemnity must be obtained from the customer. It should quote the guarantee issued by the Bank and must remain valid at minimum up to 30 days beyond expiry date of our guarantee to allow time for the bank to claim against the applicant (our client) in case of a late claim from the beneficiary. All such counter-indemnities must incorporate the &quot;cash substitution clause&quot; referred to above.<br />
                  2.3.16 <u>CANCELLATION</u><br />
                  1. As a general rule, the Operations group will cancel and remove control of a guarantee (i.e. remove the guarantee from the Books) only after the return of the original instrument. However, in the event the beneficiary has not returned the instrument even after the expiry period, the following conditions must apply prior to removal of control:<br />
                  2. No written confirmation from the customer on whose behalf the guarantee was issued is needed.<br />
                  3. A month's time has elapsed since the expiry date, inclusive of claim period.<br />
                  4. At least a month has elapsed since a follow-up letter sent by the Bank to the beneficiary asking for return of the original bond.<br />
                  5. Each cancellation not supported by the return of the original bond must be approved by the Senior Country Operations Officer and the Bank's Legal Officer/Counsel.<br />
                  6. In no case should control be removed prior to expiry date inclusive of claim period without the return of the original bond, unless the text of the guarantee is specifically worded so as not to require the return of the instrument to the Bank on expiry.<br />
                  2.3.17 <u>GUARANTEES WITHOUT EXPIRY PERIODS (OPEN ENDED GUARANTEES)</u><br />
                  In those instances where we issue a guarantee which does not carry a specific expiry date, full cash collateral will be required, including an additional margin for interest if applicable under the terms of the guarantee. This requirement may however be modified or waived by the Credit Committee, including the Managing Director, based on relationship considerations and if the credit is otherwise deemed strong.<br />
                  2.3.18 <u>INSURANCE POLICIES</u><br />
                  Units should recognise the need to analyse, monitor and spread Insurance company risk in their respective countries. To this end, each unit should have an appropriately experienced/qualified insurance Consultant or Broker produce a study, analysing the financial strength, management and reputation of the leading Insurance Company's as a basis for setting limits for exposure to each of these companies. Limits should be approved by the Credit Committee including the Managing Director. The Consultant's study should be up dated and limits reviewed annually.<br />
                  1. Physical control over insurance policies will be maintained by the Legal Department. However the Credit Department will maintain a tickler on the basis of expiry date of each policy. In those instances when the original policy is held by another bank on behalf of a syndicate of banks of which ECOBANK is a member, copies of the original policies will be used for control purposes. Two months prior to expiry the Credit Department will inform the respective account officer of the following details:<br />
                  - Name of client<br />
                  - Assets covered by policy<br />
                  - Insurance cover amount, date and name of insurance company<br />
                  - Expiry date<br />
                  - Confirmation of premium payment<br />
                  2. If the policy is not received within four weeks of expiry the Credit Department Head will send a second follow-up to the Account Officer, with a copy to the Managing Director.<br />
                  3. Where the Bank is named as a loss payee under an insurance policy, the Bank must obtain the right to take steps to maintain cover in the event that the client fails to do so.<br />
                  2.3.19 <u>INSURANCE UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT</u><br />
                  Unless specifically stated in Credit Applications for all sight or usance letters of credit, all insurance certificates will be blank endorsed to ECOBANK. Where the account party operates under an open marine policy, the following procedure will apply:<br />
                  1. A copy should be lodged with the Bank.<br />
                  2. Confirmation in the form of a receipt should evidence payment of the premiums.<br />
                  3. Each policy insured under an open marine policy must be evidenced by a specific cover note evidencing ECOBANK's interest which must be in hand no later than three weeks from the Letter of Credit opening date.<br />
                  4. Any exception to the above should be specifically stated on the CA face and an explanation provided in the Remarks Section.<br />
                  2.3.20 <u>CASH COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS AND HYPOTHECATION DOCUMENTS</u><br />
                  1. When cash collateral is accepted to secure a loan, the hypothecation agreement covering same should be perfected under the laws of the country of the depository of such cash, which may not be the same law governing the credit agreement.<br />
                  2. For example, if the credit agreement is governed by Togolese law and cash collateral deposited in France, the hypothecation agreement should be drawn to conform with the laws of France and not those of Togo.<br />
                  3. In addition, when accepting cash collateral from a customer, it must be ensured that the collateral is not subject to an already existing charge to another lender. This could happen where some lenders have a floating charge over all current assets (which would also include cash). Also the Bank accepting cash collateral must ensure that the collateral is free from all existing or future liens or encumbrances. Legal Counsel should be consulted in all cases to ensure that both conditions are complied with. In some jurisdictions it may be advisable to take a letter-of-set-off as additional support.<br />
                  2.3.21 <u>GUARANTEES SUPPORTING LOCAL CURRENCY FACILITIES</u><br />
                  It is important that there is a common understanding on guarantees obtained locally and in support of local currency facilities. In all such instances it is a requirement that:<br />
                  1. There is a separate guarantee document from the guarantor referring to the borrower and facilities guaranteed.<br />
                  2. Guarantees must be continuing.<br />
                  3. Guarantees must cover all principal and interest, fees and charges, including process costs in the event of enforcement.<br />
                  4. Guarantees must be consistent with the terms of the primary credit.<br />
                  5. Where facilities are supported by separate agreement (e.g. term loans, facilities agreements, etc.) the guarantee must be referred to, in the Security/Support Section of the main agreement.<br />
                  6. A separate guarantor fine is established and controlled in the name of the guarantor.<br />
                  7. In addition, the Bank must ensure that such guarantees:<br />
                  - Are drafted by Legal Counsel.<br />
                  - Are validity authorised and executed and<br />
                  - The terms of the primary credit agreement are not amended without the guarantor’s consent. Absence of such consent in the face of amended terms could invalidate the guarantee.<br />
                  - Are duly registered where required by local legislation.<br />
                  <a name="s2.4">2.4 </a><strong><u>CREDIT ADMINISTRATION</u></strong><br />
                  1. Credit Administration focuses on housekeeping, the credit support, control systems and other practices necessary to manage the outstanding Risk Assets to normal repayment and to properly monitor business risks.<br />
                  2. While some of the administrative functions will be handled by the Credit Department, the ultimate responsibility for an overall acceptable process for each borrower lies with the Account Manager. The Credit Administration responsibilities are summarised below:<br />
                  - Control of Credit files.<br />
                  - Safekeeping of Credit and Documentation files.<br />
                  - Follow-up for various internal expiries i.e., CA’s, Insurance, deferrals, deficiencies.<br />
                  - Control of availments and excesses over approved lines.<br />
                  - Monitoring of collateral inspections, site visits and customer calls.<br />
                  - Monitoring of repayments under term credits.<br />
                  - Responsibility for report preparation.<br />
                  3. The above responsibilities are described in full in Section Three of this Manual.<br />
                  <a name="s2.5">2.5 </a><u id="s2.5"><strong>PROBLEM RECOGNITION</strong></u><br />
                  This process block deals with the Bank’s ability to anticipate, detect, recognise, and report as early as possible potential problems within an individual borrower’s business or industry. The objective of early warning systems is to address problems while there is still time for alternative corrective actions and revision of strategy against the relationship. It is important to comprehensively document all findings in call memos, credit evaluations and discussions with management. While occasionally, and as a result of judgemental differences, an outside reviewer may classify a credit differently from the Bank’s management, “a double jump” or new classification by an independent reviewer will reflect adversely on the Bank’s rating in terms of its ability to anticipate, recognise and deal with problem credits.<br />
                  2.5.1 <u>PORTFOLIO REVIEW/RANKING</u><br />
                  One of the most effective ways of achieving an overall acceptable rating in problem recognition is by continuous contact and information gathering, both from the customer as well as the market; recording of all negative signals and discussing these with the Credit Committee and Management. This should also involve periodic review and ranking of Risk Assets along some established internal guidelines and may sometimes lead to classification of credits. Negative signals include, but are not limited to the following events:<br />
                  - Recurring casual overdrafts or line excesses that take a long time to clear.<br />
                  - Frequent delays in repayment of principal or interest payments.<br />
                  - Inability to communicate with customer and failure to disclose information.<br />
                  - Major management changes especially in financial area people and key decision makers.<br />
                  - Negative market trends, Government directives, Legal suits and/or bankruptcy threats by other creditors.<br />
                  - Deterioration of economic environment.<br />
                  - New competition in industry.<br />
                  2.5.2 <u>CLASSIFICATION OF CREDITS</u><br />
                  1. If any of the above or other similar signals point towards a deteriorating situation it may become necessary to classify the loan and thereby trigger review and approval by the next higher level of Management. Classification categories are determined by the degree of the problem.<br />
                  2. Since credit officers are expected to be well informed as to the activities of the credits under their supervision, the primary responsibility for identifying and adversely classifying credits rests with them. Adverse classifications may also be initiated by Senior management, internal auditors and Risk Asset reviewers.<br />
                  2.5.3 <u>PURPOSES</u><br />
                  1. To highlight those credits that represent an above-normal credit risk.<br />
                  2. To evaluate the degree of risk involved.<br />
                  3. To develop a strategy or action plan for the elimination of weakness and the ultimate collection of outstandings.<br />
                  4. To assist the calculation and reserving of appropriate loan loss provisions.<br />
                  2.5.4 DEFINITIONS OF CLASSIFICATIONS<br />
                  1.&quot;Uncriticized&quot; (Current): (I)<br />
                  Credits that are fully current and the orderly payment of which is without doubt.<br />
                  2.“Other Assets Especially Mentioned” (OAEM): (IA)<br />
                  Credits with evidence of weakness in the borrower's financial condition or credit worthiness, or which are subject to an unrealistic repayment programme, or which are lacking adequate collateral, credit information or documentation. If sufficiently severe or advanced, these or other conditions would warrant a worse classification. Early attention, including substantive discussions with borrowers, is required to correct deficiencies.<br />
                  3.“Substandard”: (II)<br />
                  Credits for which the normal repayment of principal and interest may tee, or has been, jeopardised by reason of severely adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic, or political nature, or by important weaknesses in collateral. No loss is foreseen, but a protracted work-out is a possibility. Prompt corrective action is required to strengthen the Bank's position as a lender, to reduce its exposure, and to ensure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower.<br />
                  4.“Doubtful”: (III)<br />
                  Credits, full repayment of which appears questionable on the basis of available information, and which therefore suggest a degree of eventual loss not yet determinable as to amount or timing. Vigorous action is required to avers or minimise losses. Non-accrual of interest is required and previously accrued and unpaid interest must be reversed. The principal should be reversed or written off to the extent deemed necessary. Any such credits should be reported to the local Board of Directors and the ETI Board.<br />
                  5.“Loss”: (IV)<br />
                  Credits that are regarded as uncollectible. Any amount so classified by account management, should be fully reserved, and previously accrued and unpaid interest must be reversed. A classification to IV does not mean that there is no potential for eventual recovery. Responsible units are expected to continue a vigorous collection effort until it is decided that no further repayment or recovery is possible. Any such credits must also be reported to the local Board of Directors as well as to the ETI Board.<br />
                  6.When a facility is classified IA or worse, the initiating unit must immediately submit a Classified Credit Memorandum (CCM) including the following minimum basic information:<br />
                  - Lines and outstandings.<br />
                  - Brief classification history.<br />
                  - For new classifications, a brief relationship background.<br />
                  - Security or Support held, inclusive of estimated asset value.<br />
                  - Summary of latest financials (highlights only).<br />
                  - Reasons for classification and action plan.<br />
                  7.Specific assignment of responsibility should be made either to a designated Credit Officer or the Risk Manager or Credit Department Head depending on the circumstances. It is important that developments are followed closely and alternative measures implemented if the credit continues to deteriorate.<br />
                  8.Management must pay continuous attention to the risk management process and ensure that there are no past due line revisions, backlog of statement spreading, slippage in calling program, unresolved documentation discrepancies, missing Account Officer or back up assignments. Credit training and coaching must be continuing at all levels.<br />
                  9.All classifications and changes in classifications must be approved by the Credit Committee, Managing Director and the CPC of ETI.<br />
                  2.5.5 <u>REPORTS</u><br />
                  1. All classified accounts must be reviewed both monthly and quarterly and Monthly Classified Loan Reports (MCLR's) and Quarterly Classified Loan Reports (QCLR's) - see Forms and Formats Section of this Manual - prepared for submission to the Crecit Committee, Managing Director and the CPC of ETI.<br />
                  2. Past due obligations (&quot;PDOs&quot;) and accounts receivable must be reviewed regularly, and timely follow-ups made to initiate corrective action and formal reports signed off by the Credit Committee and Managing Director each month.<br />
                  <a name="s2.6">2.6 </a><u id="s2.8"><strong>POLICY PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE</strong></u><br />
                  Since adherence to policy and procedure is a requirement within each process phase, a thorough understanding of the bank's overall credit policies and procedures is the quickest way to achieving an overall acceptable credit process. The elements of this block include:<br />
                  2.6.1 <u>COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS</u><br />
                  These include Government and Central Bank policies affecting banking practices in the country. Example: interest rate ceilings, reserve requirements, sectorial lending, reporting requirements, exchange control regulations, ... among others.<br />
                  2.6.2 <u>ADHERENCE TO THE BANK’S AND THE GROUP’S POLICY GUIDELINES</u><br />
                  Examples of these are credit approval and consultation requirements which are all laid clown in Section One of this Manual, and other policies such as for example maximum exposure per sector, minimum security requirements, etc... which may be laid down.<br />
                  2.6.3 <u>EXCEPTIONS/DEVIATIONS</u><br />
                  Ensuring that exceptions are kept to a minimum and when they must be made, that proper approvals are obtained.<br />
                  2.6.4 <u>CONFIDENTIALITY</u><br />
                  All corporate policies and information, both for the Bank and customers, are handled with confidentiality.<br />
                  2.6.5 <u>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</u><br />
                  Bank’s ethical practices are complied with and there are no conflicts of interest.<br />
                  2.6.6 <u>CREDIT POLICY AND PROCEDURE MANUAL</u><br />
                  The Bank’s Credit Manual is periodically reviewed and updated in light of changing corporate and external policies.<br />
                  <a name="s2.7">2.7 </a><u id="s2.7"><strong>REMEDIAL MANAGEMENT</strong></u><br />
                  The need for Remedial Management arises in relation to specific problems that have surfaced. The Management of problem loans requires a different and more intense approach than those under normal Management. Determination of remedial Action Plans is not easy it requires experience, knowledge of the borrower and the market, and there are no hard and fast rules.<br />
                  As discussed under Problem Recognition, different account classification levers reflect the seriousness of the problem and each situation calls for more or less intense remedial action.<br />
                  2.7.1 <u>RESPONSIBILITY</u><br />
                  1. Depending on the severity of classification, the bank should assign corrective action responsibility to an appropriate individual and senior Management should be closely involved in achieving targeted objectives. A few examples follow:<br />
                  2. In a classified IA situation, the bank's strategy may call for:<br />
                  - A reduction in total exposure of 20%<br />
                  - An improvement of security margin by incremental collateral.<br />
                  - A thorough review of the loan documents to ensure enforceability.<br />
                  3. Method of achieving this will involve dialogue between the Account Officer, Bank Management and Legal Counsel. The primary responsibility may rest with the Account Manager but close involvement of both Management and Legal Counsel will be required.<br />
                  4. In a classified II situation, the action plan may call for a prepayment of some of the obligations, request for the client to find alternative Bankers, calls under guarantees etc. Every step will be documented and if results are not being achieved, more serious steps (Legal action) may have to be considered.<br />
                  5. In a classified III situation, the action plan may call for legal action to enable the Bank to exercise its rights under the security arrangements, sale of collateral, appointment of a receiver or liquidator. The action plans called for here may be very time-consuming and involve several senior Bank Officers, and even outside Accountants/Receivers. Reserves and write-offs have to be properly established at this stage and the portfolio transferred from accrual to non-accrual status.<br />
                  2.7.1 <u>RESERVES AND WRITE-OFFS</u><br />
                  Whenever an account is classified IA or worse, the following guidelines for reserves is recommended: Classification Reserve<br />
                  IA 5%<br />
                  II 20%<br />
                  III 50%<br />
                  IV 100%<br />
                  All reserves must be approved by the Board of Directors regardless of amount. Until recovery efforts are discontinued, effective follow-up for collection of the risk management process.<br />
                  2.7.3 <u>LAW SUITS</u><br />
                  Legal action against any borrower, provided that such action is recommended by Legal Counsel, must be approved by the Managing Director, and confirmed by the local Board of Directors.<br />
                  2.7.4 <u>LEGAL EXPENSES</u><br />
                  All legal expenses relating to credit recoveries will be for the borrower’s account and records must be maintained of all such expenses.<br />
                  2.7.5 <u>REPORTING</u><br />
                  The classified credit memorandum (CCM) and subsequent monthly and quarterly reports should clearly bring out action plans, target dates and results should be updated and strategies revised in a timely manner.<br />
                  <a name="s2.8">2.8 </a><u><strong>ORGANISATION/STAFFING</strong></u><br />
                  This process addresses the staffing needs of the Credit and Marketing and Credit Administration Departments and can be further broken clown into three subsections:<br />
                  2.8.1 <u>STAFFING ADEQUACY</u><br />
                  The unit must be adequately staffed with people who have the ability and qualifications to meet the tasks. The staffing should also address back-up in situations when those with primary responsibility are absent. Position descriptions as well as job assignments must be formulated for each lending officer and the Credit Department.<br />
                  2.8.2 <u>STAFF CONTINUITY</u><br />
                  Average experience levers of each staff member must be sufficient to caser for job requirements and turnover must be carefully watched so that loss of experienced staff is quickly covered by more accelerated training efforts.<br />
                  2.8.3 <u>COACHING/TRAININ</u>G<br />
                  This is a very important responsibility for the Management and requires planning to ensure that both formal as well as on-the-job training needs of the lending unit and Credit Administration Department are met. To strengthen internal training, regular Credit Committee meetings are an excellent tool as they provide a forum for discussing complex credits, new marketing initiatives as well as general process issues. A11 officers must be completely familiar with the prevailing credit policy and procedure guidelines in addition to other local regulatory requirements.                <br />
