                    CAs supporting all credit facilities must be reviewed and (if necessary) renewed once every year. In order to avoid approval gaps, the renewal CA must be prepared and circulated for approval one month before the expiry date of the previous approval. For example, for a CA expiring September 30, 1991, the renewal CA and all approvals must be in place before that date. It is important that an allowance should be made where necessary, for approvals to be sought from ETI well in advance of the review dates. Where fines are not being renewed, Account Officer must place a memo, signed by the Credit Committee, confirming that the facility is not being renewed (with reasons), and therefore, allowing the credit fines to expire without renewal.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.2"><a name="s3.2">3.2 </a><u>EXTENSION IN REVISION DATES</u></strong><br />
                    In cases where the preparation of an annual review CA will be delayed, it may become necessary to request approval to continue operating under the previously approved fines, for a period of up to 90 days. Such delay may be due to fate receipt of financial statements or delays in meeting key management to obtain updated information, among other reasons. In all such situations, a request for extension must be presented in a memorandum to the Credit Committee, listing out the previously approved fines and present outstandings. This memo will give the reasons for the extension request and should normally be for a period of one month with a maximum of 90 days. Approval of such an extension must be sought from the lever required by the amount of facilities.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.3"><a name="s3.3">3.3 </a><u>BUNCHING OF CREDIT RENEWAL REQUESTS</u></strong><br />
                    During the initial CA preparation phase, care must be taken to avoid bunching (i.e. all CAs expiring in one month). While financial year end patterns may make it necessary to review more CAs at certain times of the year than at others, the account load should be as evenly distributed as possible, taking into account financial year end dates, vacation periods, etc.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.4"><a name="s3.4">3.4 </a><u>FINANCIAL STATEMENT UPDATES</u></strong><br />
                    An analysis of Financial performance is a key component in the preparation of a CA. Since most companies publish their annual statements within three to six months of the financial year end, CA revision dates should be closely aligned to fall approximately six to eight months after the financial year end to allow for receipt and analysis of the numbers. If the CA revision date is more than six months away from the previous year end closing, then the CA package should contain interim financials for the period elapsed since that year end closing. Under no circumstances should packages presented for credit approval contain figures that are more than twelve months old.<br />

                    1. Credit files are strictly confidential and must be kept in locked steel and fireproof cabinets when not in use. Only Senior officers, Account Officers, Credit Committee members and Credit Department Staff will have access to credit files. All credit files must be returned to the Credit Department each day, but if this is not practical, they must be kept under lock in steel cabinets overnight. Under no circumstances should credit files be removed from the bank premises.<br />
                    2. It will be the responsibility of the Credit Department to track the movement and custody of credit files by having an adequate requisition card system in place.<br />

                    11. Classified Credit Memorandums, Monthly and Quarterly Classified Loan Reports<br />
                    For ease of reference, it is recommended that the first section in each file should contain the credit approvals, filed in chronological order.<br />
                    3.5.3 <u id="s3.5.3">CROSS REFERENCE</u><br />
                    When lending to group, a separate file should be maintained for each borrowing entity and consolidated file maintained for the group. The group and individual files must be cross-referenced to related entities.<br />
                    3.5.4 <u id="s3.5.4">CULLING AND RETENTION OF FILED MATERIAL</u><br />
                    Except for classified credits all files must be culled periodically and at minimum once annually at the time of each annual review. Culling of credit files will be the responsibility of individual account officers. All culled material should be stored for a period of three years after final adjustment/repayment of the customers’ liability. This period may be extended in accordance with local laws and regulations.<br />
                    The following retention periods are recommended subject to local regulations:<br />
                    1. Credit Approvals - Current plus two years.<br />
                    2. Financial Memo (or Country Risk Reviews*) - Current Plus two years<br />
                    3. Basic Information Reports - Most current<br />

                    <strong id="s3.6"><a name="s3.6">3.6 </a><u>COLLATERAL STATEMENTS</u></strong><br />
                    1. Where we hold a charge over inventory and/or receivables, all borrowers will be required to submit monthly statements of all stocks and receivables within 15 days of each month-end. Stock statements must indicate opening and closing stocks of all finished goods, working-progress, raw materials and stores and spares. Receivables statements must provide a break-up in a form similar to the inventory and collateral inspection forms provided in Chapter Five of this Manual.<br />
                    2. It will be the responsibility of the Credit Administration Department to check these submissions and report any omissions to the concerned Account Officer, with copy to the Managing Director.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.7"><a name="s3.7">3.7 </a><u>COLLATERAL INSPECTIONS</u></strong><br />
                    1. For all loans secured by a charge over either inventory or receivables or both, collateral inspections must be carried out at least quarterly either by a competent bank employee or, preferably, by an outside professional agency. Any deviations from inspection requirements must be approved by the required lever of approval for the credit.<br />
                    2. It is expected that if an outside agency is used, the charges for such inspections must be negotiated and billed to the customer with his consent.<br />
                    3. Whenever collateral inspection are required subsequent to lending, the new requirement should be clearly communicated in writing to the customer and he should be aware that the Bank will make random calls on him without prior notice.<br />
                    4. The objective of a collateral inspection is two-fold:<br />
                    1. Perform a physical count of the client's stock or receivables and verify numbers against latest inventory report.<br />
                    2. Meet with the business client on a surprise basis and see how he runs the plant/keeps his books in true form (i.e. without regard to preparations for external inspections, etc...).<br />
                    5. Bearing the above in mina, our approach to the collateral inspection will therefore be as follows:<br />
                    1. Prepare an internal time schedule of relevant customers and visit them on those dates without prior notice. Even if the principal contact (eg. Chief Accountant or Financial Controller) is not available, the next person in fine should be contacted.<br />
                    2. The meeting should always stars with a discussion with this contact on general issues affecting the company's operations i.e.<br />
                    - Present state of plant, eg. is it running smoothly and producing to capacity?<br />
                    - Number of shifts/employees.<br />
                    - Any industrial/market problems affecting the company?<br />
                    3. Review company's order book for the month and also review the stocks/receivables ledger as of the nearest date and make a physical check of stocks against the stock ledger.<br />
                    A collateral inspection could also be combined with a site visit. During the tour, reviewer should make observations on all aspects of the company facility and ask any relevant questions. It is recommended to take photograph on such visit. This is especially appropriate on site visit and can be very useful to demonstrate progress between visit.<br />

                    <strong id="s3.8"><a name="s3.8">3.8 </a><u>CALL MEMORANDUM</u></strong><br />
                    Frequency of customer contact, levers contacted and the nature of calls are usually determined by the type of relationship and its problems or potential. However, the following guidelines on the frequency and scope should be considered:<br />
                    3.8.1 <u id="s3.8.1">FREQUENCY</u><br />
                    Non-classified relationships - Once a month.<br />
                    Classified Credits - Twice a month or as dictated by the established action plan in each situation.<br />
                    3.8.2 <u id="s3.8.2">SCOPE</u><br />
                    For non-classified credits, a detailed call memorandum should be prepared quarterly covering all marketing issues as they relate to the Marketing Plan, and an overall financial and qualitative update. For classified credits, fortnightly or monthly call memos, co-related to the action plans for the credit, plus financial updates.<br />
                    3.8.3 <u id="s3.8.3">PROSPECTS</u><br />
                    For all prospects on the Target Market list, each Account Manager must maintain at least a monthly calling frequency, and all call reports must be circulated to Credit Committee members before filing. A system should be in place to ensure timely follow-up action.<br />
                    3.8.4 <u id="s3.8.4">RELATIONSHIP UPDATE</u><br />
                    For all key relationships, the Bank should perform a semi-annual relationship update (in-between annual reviews) addressing:<br />
                    - Interim financial performance<br />
                    - Major developments within the company<br />
                    - Any negative industry developments that may affect the customer<br />
                    - Overall progress against our credit and marketing expectations.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.9"><a name="s3.9">3.9 </a><u>CHECKINGS</u></strong><br />
                    3.9.1 <u id="s3.9.1">BANK/TRADE</u><br />
                    Formal and informal reports obtained from outsiders can represent an important independent source of information on our customers. Formal checkings constitute those obtained from banks and, in some markets, from the trace (suppliers, buyers, etc.). Informal reports are usually obtained on probing, are verbal, as those obtained from competitors and customers, and are usually more reliable and useful than any checkings obtained in writing.<br />
                    Formal Bank checkings must be obtained on all customers once a year.<br />
                    If market practice allows, formal trace checkings must be obtained with similar frequency. Irrespective of whether formal trace checkings are available or not, Account Officers should informally contact a cross-section of the market (competitors, customers, suppliers, etc. of the subject of enquiry) on the general financial standing of the customer. Care, discretion and tact will obviously be required in soliciting this kind of information, so as not to embarrass either the bank or the borrower. As in every situation, this will require good judgement on the part of the Account Officer. All information obtained must be recorded in the Credit file.<br />
                    3.9.2 <u id="s3.9.2">REGISTRAR CHECKING</u><br />
                    Prior to accepting any charge over a company's assets, a search must be carried out at the appropriate government department to confirm that no prior charges have been registered against the security being offered. This exercise must be repeated with each CA renewal request to ensure that our security position remains unchanged and has not been diluted by the assets being charged to another lender during the year under review.<br />
                    Where such official records are not easily accessible, the services of an approved notary or lawyer may be required.<br />
                    <strong id="s3.10"><a name="s3.10">3.10 </a><u>REVIEW OF OVERDRAFTS/EXCESS</u></strong><br />
                    3.10.1 <u id="s3.10.1">REVIEW</u><br />
                    The Credit Department Head will be responsible for a weekly review of all temporary overdrafts and excesses over approved lines. In so doing, the officer will ensure that the necessary follow-up has been implemented to regularize the overdraft or excess.<br />
                    In addition, the following procedures will apply:<br />
                    - All Temporary Overdrafts (TODs) must have the prior Credit Committee approval evidenced on either the referral card or some other document.<br />
                    - No Temporary Overdraft should be outstanding for more than seven calendar days.<br />
                    - If not liquidated within 10 days, the TOD should be regularized by restructuring into a regular loan or advance facility.<br />
                  - If however, it is outstanding for 30 days or more without any effort to restructure into a formal line, or if it is restructured but the repayment schedule is not followed, it should be transferred to Past Due Obligations.
