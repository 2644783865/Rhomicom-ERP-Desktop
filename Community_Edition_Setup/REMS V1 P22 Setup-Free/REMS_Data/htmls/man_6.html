               <p> <strong> 6.01 Coverage</strong></p>
               <p>Internal Control  is expected to cover every stratum of the bank. It is not limited to any  function, area or product. Control must be institutionalized in every aspect of  the bank’s activities to safeguard the interest of the stakeholders at all  times. Our coverage shall be though not limited to the following:</p>
               <ol type="i">
                 <li><strong>Transaction review</strong> -  This involve verification, vouching and review of processed transactions</li>
                 <li><strong>Security Sweep – </strong>Based on identified control risks,  Internal Control staff conducts security sweep on processing areas in branches  and the Head Offices on ad hoc basis.</li>
                 <li><strong>Routine  Investigation</strong> – This is carried out upon discovery  of abnormal balances or open items in accounts. </li>
                 <li><strong>Spot Check on  Cash and others</strong> – This is carried out on ad hoc basis  to authenticate the physical position as reported in the related books/records  and General Ledger balances. Others include stock of various inventories.</li>
                 <li><strong>Integrity and  Control effectiveness test </strong>- These are  deliberate errors that are introduced to test the integrity of the target  officer or test the capability and competencies of the Control Officers  covering such functional areas. </li>
                 <li><strong>Process/Product  review - </strong>This involves studying the processes or  procedures and products to determine control lapses and adequacy of the  embedded controls.</li>

                 <li> Each mega and big  branch will be assigned to a Control Officer who shall be the Resident Internal  Control Officer (RICO) to such branch and be fully responsible for the control  activities of the branch and the sub-branches/outlets attached to it</li>
                 <br />
                 <li> Other branches shall  be assigned at most two branches to one Control Officer and shall operate as  Roving Control Officer to those branches</li>

               </li>
               <p>For the sake of ZICO and Roving Control Officers our  Control Officers’ activities are divided into two; Onsite and Offsite.</p>
               <p><strong>Onsite Activities</strong><br />
                 These are activities carried out by Control Officers in  respect of the branch or location where they are physically present at a  particular time. In addition to system review, the Control Officer will be in a  position to demand supporting documents and any other records necessary for review.  Environmental scanning and security sweep which are part of a Control Officer’s  job functions can only be done Onsite.</p>
               <p><strong>Offsite Activities</strong><br />
                 These are activities that are remotely performed i.e. done  from a location different from where such activities were consummated. This is  made possible with the availability of IT link. Due to insufficient number of  Control Officers Groupwide and the need to ensure that all branches are covered  by the limited number of Control Officers on ground, Offsite reviews become  inevitable as we cannot have Internal Control Officers in all the locations at  the same time. <strong></strong><br />
                 In  addition to the above reviews, Group Internal Control may from time to time  conduct specific onsite spot checks in specific affiliates.</p>

               <strong id="6.04">6.04 Proof Chart – Implementation and Review</strong>
               <p>A proof chart is maintained for every activity under Internal  Control purview. A typical proof chart contains the activities for review, step  by step procedure, date of review and frequency of review as well as signature  of the reviewer. Once the activity is performed, the box provided for such  shall be initialed by the Control Officer to indicate done. At a glance, a  supervisor can see which of the activities is not being done regularly and why  it is not being done and proffer solution.</p>
               <p>A well maintained proof chart would aid planning and  decision making.</p>
               <p>See <strong>Appendix 4</strong> for the detail of the proof charts (Operational and Risk Controls).</p>
               <div align="right"> <a href="#top">link to top</a></div>
               <strong id="6.05">6.05 Tools</strong>
               <p>The following tools are required by Control Officers for  effective discharge of their functions:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Personal Computers (PCs) and Laptops</li>
                 <li>Core banking application - For enquiries only</li>
                 <li>Audit Command Language (ACL)</li>
                 <li>Business Object- For report generation</li>
                 <li>Pool cars for ZICOs</li>
                 <li>Office automation - Microsoft applications- Excel,  Word, PowerPoint</li>
               </ul>

               <strong id="6.06">6.06 Peer review and implementation approach</strong>
               </li>
               <p>Peer review shall from time to time be carried out as a way  of assessing the effectiveness of control measures in place. In addition, with  peer review, we can ascertain whether or not the Control Officers covering the  reviewed areas have been effective and efficient in carrying out the assigned  functions. This exercise is likely to reveal some weaknesses which had not been  previously reported by the Control Officer covering that branch/area or region. </p>
               <p>The peer review will involve ZICOs, Resident Control  Officers and Roving Control Officers. It will cut across roving area, zone and  sectors e.g. Branch Control Officers against Head Office Control Officers etc<br />

               <strong id="6.07">6.07 Quality Assurance Methodology</strong>
               </li>
               <p>In order to ensure high quality standards in the  performance of Controllers, the following approach or methodology should be  adopted:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Internal Control Manual to serve as a guide and  provide standard reference point for   Internal Controllers</li>
                 <li>Use of the detailed proof chart/control  checklists by Control Officers in carrying out assignments</li>
                 <li>The dictates of the proof charts should be  strictly adhered to and all work done must be in line with agreed and approved  procedures.</li>
                 <li>Supervision of Control Officers should be done  on a continuous basis by their immediate supervisors. This will ensure that the  set standards is not compromised</li>
                 <li>Peer review as explained under section 6.06 of  this manual is another method that shall be employed to guarantee high quality  standard.</li>
                 <li>Controllers must imbibe the culture of proper  documentation of the work done and their findings. This is necessary to ensure  continuity in the set standard and any form of vacuum prevented.</li>
                 <li>Understanding and familiarizing with the various  internal policies and regulatory pronouncements </li>
                 <li>Reduce the area of control of each Control Officer.  Thus the number of branches assigned to each Control Officer must depend on the  Risk Assessment of such branches and the ability of such controller. </li>
                 <li>Regular online questionnaire/test questions to  Control Officers on various policies and regulatory pronouncements</li>
                 <li>Daily, weekly, monthly and adhoc reports from  various levels</li>

               <strong id="6.08">6.08 Working Paper</strong>
               <p>This has to do primarily with documentation of the  activities of the Controllers. Documentation and acknowledgement of work done  is very important for Internal Controllers. Request may come at any time from  external auditors, regulatory examiners or executive management in respect of  the job done in the time past and failure to produce same will have a negative  impact on the bank. </p>
               <p>Proper and effective documentation of work done and  reports where applicable cannot be over emphasized. Such documentation apart from  enhancing continuity and quality of our job may become a reference point in the  future. </p>
               <p>Documentation can come in the form of soft and hard  copies or acknowledgement of job performed through the Control Officers’  initials.</p>
               <p>Sample of expected documentations  are:</p>
               <ol type="a">
                 <li>Sign off/initiation of every documents/records  reviewed to acknowledge job done. State comments as deemed necessary to  indicate observed exception(s)</li>
                 <li>Obtain and file off copies of critical documents  to evidence certain transactions/process sought and reviewed. This can be  obtained via mail through scanning etc.</li>
                 <li>Create soft copies of exception files on the  desktop and flat files for hard copies</li>
                 <li>All Critical control reports sent weekly and  monthly to supervisors should be printed and filed in a report file tagged –  “Critical Control Issues”</li>
                 <li>Every exceptions observed MUST be reported using  the available tool (Internal control software, ACEM, etc)</li>
                 <li>All ATM load certificates copied to Control Officer  must be saved in a folder called ATM Certificates and hard copies printed to  file.</li>
                 <li>Consolidated exception reports in the Head Offices  must be printed and kept in flat files as well. </li>
               </ol>
