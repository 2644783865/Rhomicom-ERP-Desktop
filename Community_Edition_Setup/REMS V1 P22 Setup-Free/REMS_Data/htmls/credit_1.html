                <a name="s1.1">1.1 GENERAL</a><br /></strong>
                Credit approval authority is delegated to Management by the Board of Directors of ETI, in accordance with Section 1.3 below. Any extension of credit exceeding authority delegated is subject to approval by the Board of Directors of ETI itself, following recommendation to the Board by Management.<br />
                <strong><a name="s1.2">1.2 APPROVAL OF CREDIT AT AFFILIATES</a></strong><br />
                Individual approval limit are delegated to the Managing Directors of affiliates (&quot;local Managing Director&quot;) by ETI. Any extension of credit at an affiliate exceeding such delegated authority is subject to approval by ETI, following recommendation by the affiliate. Additionally, extension of credit by the affiliate may require further approval of the Board of Directors of the affiliate, following recommendation by management of the affiliate and prior approval by ETI as necessary. This is dependent on the lever of approval authority delegated by the local Board to its Management.<br />
               <strong><a name="s1.3"> 1.3 RULES GOVERNING THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT</a><br />
                <a name="sA">A. GENERAL REOUIREMENTS</a><br />
                1. APPROVAL/DOCUMENTATION<br /></strong>
                Approval for all types of credit extension shall be evidenced on the Credit Application or other authorised approval document by the signatures or initials of each of the credit officers approving the credit. Any written commitment to extend credit must be executed by a Managing Director, unless specific delegated authority has been granted to other credit officers for this purpose. Any deferral of the receipt of documentation required under credit arrangements, or otherwise essential to the granting of credit, requires the approval of the local Managing Director. If such deferral is for more than 90 days, it must be approved at the same lever as originally approved in accordance with Rule 3. Waiver of documentation or any material change in terms conditions or covenants of a credit as originally approved must be approved according to the lever required by Rule 3 as determined by the amount of aggregate facilities.<br />
                For the purposes of this rule, &quot;credit extension&quot; is used in its broadest sense and encompasses any transaction which creates an actual or potential liability to pay Ecobank. This includes not only all Risk Assets as defined in the Introduction but also other risks such as placement of Treasury funds and purchase of cheques.<br />
                <strong>2. THREE INITIAL SYSTEM</strong><br />
                Authority for credit extensions must have the joint approval of at least three credit officers (collectively referred to as &quot;Credit Committee&quot;), at least one of whom must have a personal designated credit limit covering the amount of credit extension under consideration. It is not intended that credit be extended on the judgement of one officer alone. A specific title by itself will not be sufficient to allow an officer to approve the extension of credit. Only those officers who have duties and responsibilities that involve the approval of loans and other extensions of credit are &quot;credit officers&quot;. Names and specimen initials of all credit officers must be regularly provided to the Group Credit Officer.<br />
                Specific personal designated credit limits are delegated to credit officers by the Group Managing Director on the recommendation of the Group Credit Officer, based on rank, experience and proven ability. Such limits will be advised to the ETI Board of Directors.<br />
                <strong>3. APPROVAL LEVELS</strong><br />
                Except as modified in these Rules, the minimum requirement for credit approvals are as follows:<br />

                <p>All credit approvals in excess of a local Managing Director’s limit must be reported to the local Board of Directors. The local Board will decide which such credits require its own approval, by delegating a local credit approval limit to the Managing Director. Such limit need not necessarily be the same as the group limit delegated by ETI.<br />
                  <strong>4. DESIGNATION OF SENIOR CREDIT OF FICERS<br />
                    </strong>
                  A Senior Credit Officer may be designated by the Group Managing Director with the concurrence of the ETI Board of Directors. Only officers of the rank of Managing Director or the Group Credit Officer may be designated as Senior Credit Officers. Collectively, Senior Credit Officers and the Group Credit Officer are referred to as the Senior Credit Committee.<br />
  <strong>5. TENOR AND REVIEW OF CREDIT FACILITIES<br />
  </strong>
                  Short term credit extensions, including fines of credit, shall expire one year from date of approval unless an earlier expiration is specially provided. Demand loans not covered under approved fines must be reviewed at least semi-annually and any extension or renewal approved at the lever of authority required for the amount involved as per Rule 3. Term extensions of credit must be reviewed at least annually by three credit officers with direct responsibility for administration of the credit under review, one of whom must be a member of the Senior Credit Committee if the amount is over $1,000,000.<br />
  <strong>6. CREDIT TO NEWLY ESTABLISHED ENTERPRISES OR TO BORROWERS IN NEW INDUSTRIES<br />
  </strong>
                  Facilities of $250,000 or more to newly established enterprises or to companies in relatively new industries require approval of the local Managing Director and one Senior Credit Officer. This requirement does not apply where the lending unit holds full cash collateral with good titre for the full principal amount.<br />
  <strong>7. APPROVAL WITHOUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS<br />
  </strong>
                  If credit in excess of $50,000 is extended only on the basis of either the general standing of the borrower or on balance sheets and/or income statements which are not generally available to credit officers and directors, approval is required at the next higher lever than the amount of credit would normally require. If the amount is $250,000 or more, additional approval is required by a Senior Credit Officer. This does not, however, apply where the lending unit holds full cash collateral with good titre for the principal amount. <br />
  <strong>8. INFERIOR POSITION<br />
  </strong>
                  All extensions of credit to a borrower in situations where the institution is in an inferior security position to that of other lenders extending similar credit must be approved by one level higher than would otherwise be required by Rule 3.<br />
  <strong>9. APPROVAL AND REVIEW OF ADVERSELY CLASSIFIED CREDIT FACILITIES<br />
  </strong>
                  (a) Adversely classified credits inherently involve greater risk than facilities which are current. Therefore, the minimum requirement for all adversely classified credit facilities is approval at the next higher level than would be required if the facilities were not adversely classified. If the aggregate amount exceeds $500,000, approval must be obtained from a Senior Credit Officer.<br />
                  (b) Availments under credit facilities which are adversely classified and have been previously approved under this Rule 9 may be approved by credit officers as follows:<br />
                  - if the amount is not over $250,000 by the local Managing Director;<br />
                  - If the amount is over $250,000 by a member of Senior Credit<br />
                  Committee.<br />
                  (c) Regardless of the scheduled review date, any credit facility including loans, commitments, lines of credit and contingent liabilities should be referred to the next higher level of credit authority for review and development of future strategy immediately after it has been adversely classified. Thereafter, credits classified II or worse must be reviewed monthly and credits classified IA at least quarterly by a member of the Senior Credit Committee.<br />
                  (d) A list of these classifications is contained in <a href="credit_2.html#s2">Section 2</a> of this Manual.<br />
  <strong>10. SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES: INTERNAL CREDIT POLICY<br />
  </strong>
                  Subsidiaries and affiliates must establish their own Rules governing the extension of Credit substantially in conformity with the present Group Rules governing the Extension of Credit and be submitted to ETI for approval. In addition, such Rules and any subsequent changes must be approved by their respective local Board of Directors.<br />
  <strong>11. LOANS TO PERSONNEL<br />
  </strong>
                  Loans to any personnel (except under an approved personnel plan) of either ETI or any of its subsidiaries must be approved by a Senior Credit Officer.<br />
  <strong>12. LOANS TO DIRECTORS<br />
  </strong>
                  Any loans to Directors of ETI or to any Directors of its subsidiaries or affiliates, or to any &quot;Director-related&quot; companies or firms are governed by the policy set out in Appendix I of Section I of this Manual.<br />
  <strong>13. RULES INTERPRETAION AND CHANGES<br />
  </strong>
                  The purpose of these Rules is to establish disciplines for the orderly extension of credit. Accordingly, should interpretation be required, a member of the Senior Credit Committee should be consulted. In any case, the Rules should always be interpreted in a conservative manner consistent with their underlying purpose. All credit officers must be thoroughly familiar with these Rules, as well as the credit policies and procedures of the units for which they serve as lending officers. In addition, they should be familiar with all local banking regulations of the countries where these units are located.<br />
                  Any change in these Rules should be approved by the Board of Directors of ETI based on the recommendation of the Senior Credit Committee.</p>

                <strong><a name="sB"> B. EXCEPTIONS AND DELEGATIONS</a><br /></strong>
                (i) Availment under approved lines of credit<br />
                All approved lines of credit are considered available to the customer, once all documentation has been received reviewed and confirmed to be in order by the Credit Administration Unit. In the case of overdrafts, an initial one-off availment1 ticket must be approved by two members of the Credit Committee (including the Managing Director) before the first drawing may be permitted. Subsequent movement over the account does not require approval provided there is room under the overdraft line.<br />
                All other availments will be approved by two members of the Credit Committee (including the Managing Director), who will initial the availment ticket before processing. The availment procedure is described in detail in Section 4 of this Manual.<br />
                (ii) Sub-Allocations<br />
                The Credit Committee may approve excesses over certain lines of credit to be sub-allocated against the unutilized portion of another credit line provided that the shift is to a line of equal or lower risk. Tenor and security are the factors which determine the degree of risk.<br />
                As example, an excess over a clean advance line can be covered by a sub-allocation from the unutilized portion of a clean LC line. An excess in a secured LC line (sight credit) can be covered under the unutilized portion of a clean LC line. An excess over a secured term credit line, however, can not be covered against an unsecured overdraft line. Sub-allocations may not occur between different borrowing entities even if they are within the same group and are on the same CA.<br />
                (iii) Temporary overdrafts/excesses over approved lines<br />
                All extensions of credit should address line adequacy and ensure that as far as possible no excesses or temporary increases will be required during the life of the credit. In situations where temporary excesses are requested, these will require full Credit Committee approval and must not exceed 10% of the customer's credit line or the local Credit Committee's authorised credit limit, whichever is longer. Any excess not regularised within the first seven calendar days will require further approval on an offering ticket. If the excess is still outstanding after 30 days, this will need to be regularised by way of an interim CA or transfer to past due obligation category.<br />

Drawings exceeding the Customer Service Head's limit will require approval by the Senior Branch Operations Officer for accounts which are not classified and by two members of the Credit Committee including the Managing Director for accounts which are classified.<br />
                If conditions 1 and 2 of paragraph 1.4 are not complied with for any drawing requested, all cheques must be posted on a referral card and Credit Committee approval requested before payment is made.<br />

                <strong>1.8 RETURN OF CHEQUES<br /></strong>
                All unpaid cheques must be referred to the account officer before being returned.<br />
